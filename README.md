# AI-Weather-Prediction-for-Hikers
Problem:- Hiking is awesome, but unpredictable weather can really mess things up. We want to help hikers by creating an app that tells them if it’s going to be sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy before they hit the trails.
Goal:-I want to build a model that looks at past weather data and predicts what the weather will be like. This way, hikers can make better decisions about their trips.
The Data i am Using:-i found a cool weather dataset with info from 18 places in Europe.

Data Overview:
Source: Kaggle dataset
Quality Assessment Results:
Size: 10,000 rows
Null Values: 150 rows to clean up
Outliers: Extreme values noted for review
Total Records: Approximately 10,000

Getting to Know the Data:
To get a clear picture, here’s how the data looks so far:

Completeness: The dataset covers essential weather factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation), which seem complete at first glance.
Null Values: Some records have missing values. I’ll decide whether to fill these gaps with averages or remove those rows, depending on how critical they are.
Extreme Values: There are some unusual values, like very high or low temperatures, that I’ll need to handle to avoid skewing results.
Data Types: The data includes integers and floats for weather measures, plus dates stored as strings. I’ll need to convert the date format to make it compatible with our model.
Relevant Fields: To start, I’ll focus on temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and date/time.

Classification
i am going to put the weather into four easy categories:

Sunny: Clear skies and no rain.
Cloudy: Lots of clouds with some humidity.
Rainy: It’s raining.
Snowy: Cold weather with snow.

Why Classification?
i am going with classification because it’s all about sorting the weather into clear categories, and that’s what we want to do.

An AI weather prediction tool enhances hiker safety by providing real-time classifications of weather conditions, such as "Safe," "Caution," and "Unsafe," based on various factors like rain, snow, and cloud cover. By enabling hikers to make informed decisions, this app not only promotes safer adventures but also helps them plan their trips more effectively, ensuring enjoyable and risk-free experiences in the great outdoors
